# bike_project
This is a ML project that predicts the price of a bike based on certain details filled by the user.

It includes the Linear regression Model in Machine Learning through which we trained our dataset (Used_Bikes.csv) on TRAINING DATA and then tested it on TEST DATA that resulted in prediction of the bike's prices.

Using HTML, we created the front end and then joined the back-end with it using Flask.

We created our database and table in python file and connected it with MySQL terminal that will store the data (details of bike) inputted by the user.

And this is how the project goes.
